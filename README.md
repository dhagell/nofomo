NO More Fear Of Missing Out

This contract takes advantage of a number of smartcontracts modeled from the Jekyll Island FoMo3D Exit Scam game.  These contracts are not supposed to be playable by non-humans.  The Here is the current code.

These are the target type contracts along with some copycat games.  However in particular, there is one copycat, which appears to have been fully botted.  Meaning all of the players are bots, and by using the wealth redistribution mechanism, the ether can be recycled to controlled addresses.
The rogue botted contract called 'Last Winner' has the ability to increase the entire Ethereum gas price by a 10x factor and sustain at a high rate.  This has a direct impact on the economics of doing transaction on Ethereum network itself (if the price is 10x and maintained for a period).

The games have a number of security flaws.

Modifier - OnlyHuman()

Random Number Seed

Integrer Overflow

All three of these are utilized to bypass and effectivly win the jackpot almost everytime.  Just need to have enough Agent contracts to cover the probabilities of creating the winning address within the blocktime.  This is tested with 172 agents.

Here is an example of a winning transaction.

Profit = Win - (Gas + Bet) + 10%

Profit = 0.13 - (0.012 + 0.1) + 0.01
